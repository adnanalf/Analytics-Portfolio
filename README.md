# Analytics-Portfolio
Analytics portfolio using SQL, Excel, and data projects across healthcare and business domains.

I'm an MSc candidate in Data Science, Analytics & AI at Carleton University, graduating June 2026. My background bridges healthcare research (CHEO, medical imaging) and regulated financial services (RBC). I'm building this portfolio to sharpen the analytics skills that turn data into decisions; leveraging SQL, Excel, Python, Tableau with a focus on healthcare, product, and strategy roles.
